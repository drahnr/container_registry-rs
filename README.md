# rockslide

## macOS suppport

macOS is supported as a tier 2 platform to develop rockslide itself, although currently completely untested for production use. [podman can run on Mac OS X](https://podman.io/docs/installation), where it will launch a Linux virtual machine to run containers. The `rockslide` application itself and its supporting nix-derivation all account for being built on macOS.
